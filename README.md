# Usage
### For Linux and Mac:

```
$ export FLASK_APP=flaskr

$ export FLASK_ENV=development

$ flask run
```

### For Windows cmd
Use set instead of export:

```
> set FLASK_APP=flaskr

> set FLASK_ENV=development

> flask run
```

After that you need to initialize database:
```
flask init-db
```

And now you are ready to start app:
```
flask run
```
